![ci](https://github.com/danhper/eclair/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Eclair is a Solidity interpreter designed to provide a fast and intuitive [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
to interact with EVM smart contracts using Solidity.

The documentation can be found here: https://docs.eclair.so

Here is a sample session using Eclair that interacts with smart contracts deployed on [Optimism](https://optimism.io/) using a [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/).
