# Project status

Eclair is still in its early stages of development but is already functional enough for many common blockchain tasks and interactions.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of features that are planned:

- Improved call traces
- Support for overloaded functions and events

Some time also needs to be spent on improving performance and memory usage but it is not a priority for now.

Feature requests are very welcome but please provide a clear use case and context for the feature you are requesting.
Contributions are also more than welcome.
