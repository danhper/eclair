# Project status

Eclair is still in its early stages of development but is already functional enough for many common blockchain tasks and interactions.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of features that are planned:

- Support for forking with anvil
- Support for call traces
- Better account support (e.g. keystore, easily switch between wallets)
- Support for event fetching and decoding

Feature requests are very welcome but please provide a clear use case and context for the feature you are requesting.
Contributions are also more than welcome.
